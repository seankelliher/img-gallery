## Reflection

I wanted to build (from scratch) a slide carousel that accommodates different viewing patterns and did not rely on a library such as jQuery. This carousel uses only "vanilla JavaScript." It features a main player and a gallery of thumbnail images - one for each slide in the carousel - below it.

Users can click a thumbnail to immediately view a specific slide in the carousel. They can also use the main player's "advance" and "retreat" arrows to view the entire carousel sequentially. Text is pulled from the selected image's "alt" tag and displayed as a caption below the main player.
